# Avans Green

This is a project for Avans Green, an initiative to reduce food waste at Avans. 
The project contains an application where Avans Green users can login and canteenemployees can create and manage packages and students can make and remove reservations. 

Furthermore the project has two API's, one GraphQL API where anyone can retrieve packets, with endpoints for all packets, available packets and a packet by id. 
The other API is a RESTful web API RMM level 2, where students can be logged in and get their reservations, make new reservations and delete reservations they've already made.
